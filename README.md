# nvim
This is my neovim config. This is a submodule of my [dotfiles](https://github.com/matsixfive/.dotfiles) repo due to cross-platformness.

## TODO:
- check any changes needed for nvim v0.10
- take a look at [git-blame](https://github.com/f-person/git-blame.nvim) plugin similar to vscode codelens blame
- automatic filetype detection based off shebang on first line of files with no extension or recognisable filename:
  - `#!/usr/bin/bash`
  - `#!/bin/bash`
  - `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
